# API performance monitoring and error tracking

### Overview

In an era where modern applications demand rapid responsiveness and flexible scalability, monitoring and tracking API operations play a crucial role in ensuring service quality (SLA), system performance, and early detection of incidents. This workshop is designed to provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement a comprehensive API Monitoring system on the AWS Serverless platform, leveraging core services such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, while integrating monitoring tools like CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics, CloudWatch Alarms, SNS, and AWS X-Ray to:

- Monitor the performance of each API endpoint.

- Analyze detailed errors across different processing layers.

- Trigger real-time alerts when performance thresholds are exceeded or critical errors occur.

- Ensure compliance with predefined SLA metrics.

- Automate log collection and analysis to optimize operational workflows.
