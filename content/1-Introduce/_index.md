Before diving into implementing a full API monitoring solution, it‚Äôs important to understand the core concepts of **Serverless Monitoring** and how AWS observability tools integrate seamlessly within serverless environments.

### üîç Serverless Monitoring & Observability

While serverless applications eliminate infrastructure management, they introduce new challenges in monitoring, debugging, and ensuring SLA compliance. To address this, AWS offers a comprehensive suite of tools to:

- Monitor performance metrics
- Trace execution flows
- Trigger real-time alerts

‚Äî All without managing servers.

### üß© AWS Services Used

In this project, we‚Äôll build an **end-to-end API monitoring system** using serverless architecture, incorporating the following AWS services:

- **Compute:** AWS Lambda
- **API Management:** Amazon API Gateway
- **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB
- **Monitoring & Observability:**
  - Amazon CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging
  - CloudWatch Metrics for tracking latency, traffic, and errors
  - CloudWatch Alarms + SNS for real-time alerting
  - AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing and performance analysis

### üß† Overview of AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run backend logic in response to events without provisioning or managing infrastructure. Benefits include:

- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Seamless integration with API Gateway and CloudWatch
- Event-driven architecture with flexible memory and timeout configuration

### üõ†Ô∏è Hands-on Implementation

In this workshop, you‚Äôll be guided through building a full serverless monitoring system, including:

- Creating a Lambda-based API with API Gateway
- Integrating CloudWatch Logs and Metrics for performance tracking
- Setting up CloudWatch Alarms with SNS to notify on anomalies
- Enabling AWS X-Ray for request tracing and error diagnosis
- Visualizing metrics and logs for continuous monitoring
- Writing basic documentation for monitored APIs

‚úÖ **Outcome:** By the end of this workshop, you‚Äôll have a fully observable, alert-driven, serverless API system ‚Äî powered entirely by native AWS services.
