## Preparation

Enabling and configuring **logs** and **tracing** in **API Gateway** (REST API) helps you monitor, debug, and analyze the behavior of your application effectively.

### Objectives:

- Enable **Access Logs** to capture detailed request/response data.
- Enable **Execution Logs** to trace internal execution steps (for REST APIs).
- Enable **X-Ray Tracing** to follow the request flow across AWS services like API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB.

---

### Steps to configure:

#### 1. Access API Gateway

- Sign in to AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
- Search for **“API Gateway”** and select the service.

#### 2. Select your target API

- Go to **API Gateway** → Select your API
- Click **Stages** → Choose a stage (e.g., dev, prod)
- Click **Edit** in the **Logs and Tracing** section

- **Errors and info logs**: Capture both errors and detailed request/response info (recommended for debugging).
- **Data tracing**: Log full request and response payloads.
- **Detailed metrics**: Enable detailed CloudWatch metrics including count, latency, 4XX, and 5XX errors.
- **X-Ray tracing**: Activate AWS X-Ray to trace full request flow through services.

Next: Use **CloudWatch Metrics**, **Logs Insight**, **Alarm**, **Dashboard**, and **X-Ray** to monitor your APIs.
